Have you ever shared a link somewhere and wondered where those little preview images of websites come from? Well if you didn’t know, they are called OpenGraph tags&mldr;I managed to generate some sweet og:images using Hugo’s image manipulation tools.
I&rsquo;ve been wanting to setup social share images for a while, but I figured it would be too complicated or time consuming to manage, so I never got around to it. That is, until I found Aaro&rsquo;s blog post! Turns out it is super simple to have Hugo (what this site is built on) generate OpenGraph images for you!
