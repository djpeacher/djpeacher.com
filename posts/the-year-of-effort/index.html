Just like financial debt, effort debt accrues &ldquo;interest&rdquo; and must eventually be &ldquo;paid back&rdquo;. If you can&rsquo;t afford it, don&rsquo;t take on effort debt.</p><p>Effort investment occurs when you prioritize long-term goals over short-term convenience by making thoughtful, deliberate choices. Just like financial investments, effort investment &ldquo;compounds&rdquo; over time, creating value and reducing future work or stress. By making intentional, strategic decisions today, you build a foundation that supports sustained progress and minimizes the need to &ldquo;pay back&rdquo; effort later.</p><a href="mailto: reply@djpeacher.com?subject=RE: The%20Year%20of%20Effort">Reply via email</a></main><footer style=border:none></footer></body></html>
