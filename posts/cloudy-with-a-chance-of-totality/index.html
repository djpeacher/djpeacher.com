So I drove to my viewing spot in the path of totality and set up shop.</p><p>As predicted, it was very cloudy, and I struggled to find the right settings for the camera, but was able to dial it in just enough when the sun poked through the clouds. As the time drew near&mldr;and then past&mldr;I was worried I wasn&rsquo;t going to see anything, but a few minutes later the clouds parted just enough for me to get some, I think, amazing amateur shots! It was really fun watching the moon make its way across the sun.</p><p>My dreams were short-lived however as, right before totality, the clouds returned, blocking out the money shot! I was incredibly disappointed, but at least I was able to enjoy the eerie feeling of day turning to night.</p><p>Ah well, I guess I will just have to try again in 2045!</p><figure><img alt="Cloudy with a chance of totality" src=/posts/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-totality/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-totality001.jpg loading=lazy><figcaption>1/20s, f/28/5, ISO , 250mm, Canon Canon EOS Rebel T6s</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="Cloudy with a chance of totality" src=/posts/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-totality/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-totality002.jpg loading=lazy><figcaption>1/30s, f/28/5, ISO , 250mm, Canon Canon EOS Rebel T6s</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="Cloudy with a chance of totality" src=/posts/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-totality/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-totality003.jpg loading=lazy><figcaption>1/15s, f/28/5, ISO , 250mm, Canon Canon EOS Rebel T6s</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="Cloudy with a chance of totality" src=/posts/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-totality/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-totality004.jpg loading=lazy><figcaption>13/10s, f/28/5, ISO , 250mm, Canon Canon EOS Rebel T6s</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="Cloudy with a chance of totality" src=/posts/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-totality/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-totality005.jpeg loading=lazy><figcaption>1/623s, f/12/5, ISO , 8/5mm, Apple iPhone 12</figcaption></figure><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>April 8, 2024&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><a href="mailto: reply@djpeacher.com?subject=RE: Cloudy%20with%20a%20chance%20of%20totality">Reply via email</a></main><footer style=border:none></footer></body></html>
