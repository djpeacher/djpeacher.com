This is a great suggestion! I&rsquo;ve just been using standard tally marks, but I could definitely see how this streamlines things. Going to have to try it out at my next game.

Use standard tallies for remainders. When you cross out 5 tallies, create a new <code>/</code> and disregard those tallies.</p><a href="mailto: reply@djpeacher.com?subject=RE: Tracking%20Monster%20Damage%20With%20Xs%20and%20Slashes">Reply via email</a></main><footer style=border:none></footer></body></html>
