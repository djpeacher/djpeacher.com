Display. I was a little disappointed with the display.

It‚Äôs not everyday you get to try out a new Apple product.</p><p>Here are some of my first impressions:</p><p><em>Display</em>. I was a little disappointed with the display. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a really good display, but I was really hoping Apple would have come out swinging with something orders of magnitude better than the competition. I found the display too dim and pixelated, slow at times, and contained too much <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignetting>vignetting</a> around the edges. I think the only thing that saved the display for me were the prescription eye inserts.</p><p><em>Controls</em>. The eye-hand controls are by far the defining feature of the Vision Pro. It was incredibly intuitive and eerily accurate. It honestly felt like it was reading my mind, and I quickly started zooming around the UI. I did get a few false positives here and there, but I think I‚Äôll blame my fidgety hands for that. One thing I didn‚Äôt like too much however, was that it really made me think about what my eyes were doing, and I could already feel the strain in the short time that I used it. Only thing I forgot to try was the virtual keyboard&mldr;eh, it was probably bad anyway.</p><p><em>3D Content</em>. I was shown some of the 3D photos and videos you can create, and too be honest they just felt like blurry <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing>lenticular cards</a> and were not all that interesting. 3D movies were fun to see again, and the 3D environments you can place yourself in were a bit more intriguing, but it was Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúImmersive Videos‚Äù where things really started to shine. They were absolutely amazing, and it nearly brought a tear to my eye because I really felt like I was there&mldr;I left wanting more.</p><p><em>Comfort</em>. Generally speaking, it was comfortable, but wow was it heavy. I felt the pressure mostly along my nose and cheek bones, and I could feel it well after the session had ended, not to mention the prominent red mark around my face. I know Apple really wants everyone to use that &ldquo;solo knit band&rdquo;, but I would probably never use it in favor of the &ldquo;dual loop band&rdquo;.</p><p>So, am I going to buy the Vision Pro? No! It is way too expensive, not to mention the accessories, but if I had a few thousand dollars lying around, sure I&rsquo;d buy one. I do think it&rsquo;s an amazing product, and the start of an exciting journey, but I could never justify it in its current state. Besides, we all know what the end game is here ü§ì</p><a href="mailto: reply@djpeacher.com?subject=RE: Trying%20out%20the%20Vision%20Pro">Reply via email</a></main><footer style=border:none></footer></body></html>
