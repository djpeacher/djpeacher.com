Day 1
Keynote: The Design of Everyday APIs

The Design of Everyday Things - Don Norman
Good API design is intuitive, flexible, and simple.
Intuitive:

Use domain nomenclature
Clumsy naming hints at clumsy abstractions
Provide symmetry


Flexible:

Provide sane defaults
Minimize repetition
Be predictable and precise
Let users be lazy


Simple:

Provide composable functions
Leverage language idioms
Provide convenience


Provide a good README:
# README
## Installation
## Get Started
## Learn More


Python Code vs Pythonic Code

Experts &ldquo;recognize&rdquo;, beginners &ldquo;reason&rdquo;
Python Power Moves

Decorators
Comprehensions
Generators
Slicing


Why is python hard?

Python code != Pythonic code
Python code != <any other language&rsquo;s concepts>
Python is (too) easy
What memory
Python needs lots of testing
All about those libraries&mldr;



ContainerCraft: Mastering Efficient Integration Testing

https://testcontainers.com/

Anarchy to Order - Organizing Assorted Data with Python and LLMs

Links in a graph are not enough, we need to label those links to create a knowledge graph.
Graph databases (like Neo4j) does this!

No FKs, very flexible, label relationships



Lessons Learned Maintaining Open-Source Python Projects

What is a maintainer? They keep projects operational and in an appropriate condition.
What is not a maintainer? Someone who adds new features or fixes issues&mldr;that would be a contributor.
What does a maintainer do?

Ensures package and information about it is discoverable.
Ensures consumption and contribution is familiar.
Sets ground rules (hint: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Triages incoming bug reports (hint: use templates).
Grooms and rejects incoming feature requests (hint: think of long-term good rather than short term gain).
Reviews pull request (hint: require tests, changelogs, ruff code reformatting, and commit squashing when needed).
Cuts releases with a changelog (hint: think small and often. have version and deprecation policies).
Thanks contributors.
Ensures the projects architecture remains consistent.
Lets other people help (hint: CONTRIBUTING.md).
Ensure CI remains green and fast (hint: don&rsquo;t forget to rebuild docs, add pull request warning).
Fosters community (hint: issue tracker, slack/discord, social, stack overflow).
Mentors and convert good contributors to co-maintainers.
Ensures they can keep doing it (hint: priorities mental and physical health, it&rsquo;s okay to step away)


Why be a maintainer?

Looks good on your CV.
Gives opportunities to meet people.
Mentoring experience.


How to be a maintainer?

Pick something you use actively use on a semi-regular basis.
Read the docs in detail.
Practice by trying to solve an issue and reach out to the current maintainer.
Know communication is deceptively hard, we all have different communication styles.

Be polite and patient, and give people the benefit of doubt.





Working with Audio in Python

Very cool lesson on how digital audio works.
Pedalboard provides useful abstractions around audio files.
Always process audio files as a stream to handle any size of input.
Use numpy for faster operations.

Rest Easy with Jupyrest

Jupyrest turns jupyter notebooks into json APIs.

Iterate, Iterate, Iterate!

more-itertools 😍

Voice Computing with Python in Jupyter Notebooks

You can write faster (and avoid RSI) by using your voice instead of typing.
You can be even faster by defining text replacement commands (e.g. &ldquo;insert code block&rdquo;).

Lightning Talks

You can make LLMs smarter by feeding it new data in the system prompt.
Recurse Center: Social Rules

No well-actually’s
No feigned surprise
No backseat driving
No subtle -isms


How to give a talk:

Be Engaging
Be Loud
Be Big (60pt font)
Be Prepared
Be Considerate


Tips for giving a good talk:

Tell a story
Find your signposts (break points)
Practice
The energy you give is energy you get
expect (and prepare for) the unexpected



Day 2
Keynote: Thriving with Python

How do we succeed in a polyglot world? Choose the best language for the job.
How do we avoid the pitfalls?

Avoid chasing speed. All languages have tradeoffs.
Avoid swooning at shiny. All languages will eventually bloat.
Avoid hype and FOMO. Pretend it&rsquo;s the news.
