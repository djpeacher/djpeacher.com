The web allows us to create content that is connected with the rest of the web. Everything we do, especially us writers, is kicked off by something someone else said, and we should embrace that. Make your blog a part of a conversation, not an island that feels like you’re just doing this all on your own. None of us are, and we should be proud of that.

I realize now that link blogging deserves to be included a third category of low stakes, high value writing. We could think of that category as things I’ve found.</p></blockquote><p>I want to post more on this site, but I consistently struggle to find the time and the attention span to write up a good post. So I&rsquo;m going to try link blogging, something two of my favorite, and most prolific, bloggers, Matt Birchler and Simon Willison, do on a regular basis.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still going to try to write some more long-form posts when inspiration strikes, but I&rsquo;m hoping that these lower-stakes posts will help me build up a regular posting habit. Plus, I think they serve as a good reference for things I&rsquo;ve found and thought were interesting.</p><a href="mailto: reply@djpeacher.com?subject=RE: Going%20to%20try%20link%20blogging">Reply via email</a></main><footer style=border:none></footer></body></html>
