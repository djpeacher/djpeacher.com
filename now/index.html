One large work project complete, now on to the next, even larger project. Looking forward to attending PyTexas this month for the third year in a row! One silver lining of being woken up at 4am every day by a tiny human is that I&rsquo;ve been getting a lot side project time in.</p><h2 id=2503>2503</h2><p>Working my way through a few large projects at work. Having fun learning SwiftUI and actually releasing apps (<a href=https://apps.apple.com/app/id6737578148>Luminary</a>, <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crit-happens-dice-roller/id1550370579>Crit Happens</a>)! Super stoked to have my dice roller app <a href="https://youtu.be/5emXJhpZjDY?t=503">spotlighted by Sly Flourish</a>! Exploring AI coding tools like <a href=https://www.cursor.com/>Cursor</a> and honestly really impressed. Enjoying the speed boost of upgrading from an M1 to an M4 Mac. My wife and I were part of our best friends wedding party and we had a blast! Got sick afterwards which makes me sick for around 50% of 2025 so far&mldr;</p><h2 id=2408>2408</h2><p>Learning how to take care of a tiny human and be a father. Adjusting to the humidity. In a war with mosquitoes. Catching up on my feeds. Getting organized.</p></main><footer style=border:none></footer></body></html>
