Adventurers, take heed! Crit Happens is offered freely for all to use, though it comes with no guarantees or enchanted warranties. The core tools of your quest are free, while some advanced features require an offering to unlock.

No personal secrets are gathered here—your identity remains your own. An ally, RevenueCat, aids in tracking purchases anonymously, but fear not, for no personal information is gathered on this journey. For those who seek their full terms, [consult the tomes on their website](https://www.revenuecat.com/terms/).

By venturing forth with Crit Happens, you agree to these terms and accept that they may evolve as the story unfolds.
