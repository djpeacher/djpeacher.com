This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and this is what I'm currently up to:

## 2505

Trying to clear the decks and fight off entropy physically, virtually, and mentally. Working on a companion app for reading Fighting Fantasy books. Started properly delving into the Shadowdark and prepping for a potential campaign. Binged lots of shows, including Last of Us, Handmaids Tale, and Survivor.

## 2504

Starting to lose some of that new year momentum and feeling things start to fall through the cracks. Doing a lot of self-reflecting and trying to figure out what's next. Trying to fix some broken phones I have laying around so I can offload some apps I compulsively open. Lots of friend and family time recently. Cut my hair for the first time since having a tiny human.

## 2503

This month has been an exercise in balancing competing API limits. One large work project complete, now on to the next, even larger project. Looking forward to attending PyTexas for the third year in a row! One silver lining of being woken up at 4am every day by a tiny human is that I've been getting a lot side project time in.

## 2502

Working my way through a few large projects at work. Having fun learning SwiftUI and actually releasing apps ([Luminary](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6737578148), [Crit Happens](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crit-happens-dice-roller/id1550370579))! Super stoked to have my dice roller app [spotlighted by Sly Flourish](https://youtu.be/5emXJhpZjDY?t=503)! Exploring AI coding tools like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and honestly really impressed. Enjoying the speed boost of upgrading from an M1 to an M4 Mac. My wife and I were part of our best friends wedding party and we had a blast! Got sick afterwards which makes me sick for around 50% of 2025 so far...

## 2408

Learning how to take care of a tiny human and be a father. Adjusting to the humidity. In a war with mosquitoes. Catching up on my feeds. Getting organized.
