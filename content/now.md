This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about), too!

I'm living in Austin, TX with my wife and four cats. I'm working for The Texas Tribune as a full-stack software engineer. I'm working my way through Candlekeep Mysteries as the DM for our group. My wife and I are playing a lot of Baldur's Gate 3 ðŸŽ²
