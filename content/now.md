I'm still living in Austin with my wife and four cats! We celebrated our first wedding anniversary with a belated [trip to Italy](/posts/italy/)! I'm working for The Texas Tribune as a full-stack software engineer. I discovered digital library cards and have been plowing through various audiobooks and ebooks! I'm DM'ing Candlekeep Mysteries for my wife and friends.
