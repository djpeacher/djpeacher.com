## Life {{< twa sun >}}

I live in Austin, TX with my fiancée and our 4 cats (Cisco, Sammy, Milo, & Remy)! My fiancée and I have been together for 6 years and we are finally getting married this December! {{< twa ring >}}

In other news, my sister gave birth to a healthy baby boy, and I am now an uncle! I can't wait for us to be the cool aunt and uncle when he grows up! {{< twa baby-light-skin-tone >}}

## Learning {{< twa brain >}}

I'm currently working through all the [Code With Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com) courses I find interesting. I find Mosh's courses to be extremely thorough and well produced. Some of these courses aren't anything new to me, but I figured it never hurts to refresh your memory and maybe fill in some gaps.

## Creating {{< twa hammer >}}

Right now I am tinkering with how this looks and how I am going to use it. For looks, I'm adapting [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org) into a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme which you can view the source of on [GitHub](https://github.com/djpeacher/simple-hugo). As for how I'm going to use this site, that is still developing, but I want to write more so I added [/posts](/posts) to help me with that.
