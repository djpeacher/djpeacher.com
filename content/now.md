## Life {{< twa sun >}}

I live in Austin, TX with my fiancée and our 4 cats (Cisco, Sammy, Milo, & Remy)! My fiancée and I have been together for 6 years and we are finally getting married this December! {{< twa ring >}}

In other news, my sister gave birth to a healthy baby boy, and I am now an uncle! I can't wait for us to be the cool aunt and uncle when he grows up! {{< twa baby-light-skin-tone >}}
