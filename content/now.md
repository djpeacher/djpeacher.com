## Life {{< twa sun >}}

I live in Austin, TX with my fiancée and our 4 cats (Cisco, Sammy, Milo, & Remy)! My fiancée and I have been together for 6 years and we are finally getting married this December! {{< twa ring >}}

We've been trying to work out more and we've made some progress. This year so far we have logged 24 workouts! {{< twa flexed-biceps-light-skin-tone >}}

In other news, my sister gave birth to a healthy baby boy, and I am now an uncle! I can't wait for us to be the cool aunt and uncle when he grows up! {{< twa baby-light-skin-tone >}}

## Work {{< twa briefcase >}}

I work for the University of Texas at Austin as a Software Engineer for the [Expanding Pathways in Computing](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/epic) (EPIC) unit. My primary focus here is the development of [UTakeIt](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu) and the [EPIC Cyber Range](https://cyberrange.tacc.utexas.edu). {{< twa man-technologist-light-skin-tone >}}

We've been working from home since the pandemic started, but have recently started transitioning back to the office. {{< twa face-with-medical-mask >}}

## Learning {{< twa brain >}}

I'm currently working through all the [Code With Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com) courses I find interesting. I find Mosh's courses to be extremely thorough and well produced. Some of these courses aren't anything new to me, but I figured it never hurts to refresh your memory and maybe fill in some gaps.

- Mastering React
- The Ultimate React Native Series
- The Ultimate Redux Course
- The Ultimate Design Pattern Series
- The Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms Bundle
- ~~The Ultimate HTML5 & CSS3 Series~~
- ~~Complete SQL Mastery~~
- ~~Complete Python Mastery~~
- ~~The Complete Node.js Course~~
- ~~The Ultimate Docker Course~~
- ~~The Ultimate Git Course~~
- ~~The Ultimate Django Series~~
- ~~The Ultimate JavaScript Mastery Series~~

## Creating {{< twa hammer >}}

Right now I am tinkering with how this looks and how I am going to use it. For looks, I'm adapting [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org) into a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme which you can view the source of on [GitHub](https://github.com/djpeacher/simple-hugo). As for how I'm going to use this site, that is still developing, but I want to write more so I added [/posts](/posts) to help me with that.

## Reading {{< twa open-book >}}

I'm having a little trouble finding the time to read, but when I do, I'm currently making my way through these books:

- Immune by Philipp Dettmer
- Dune by Frank Herbert
- The Forest of Doom by Ian Livingstone
