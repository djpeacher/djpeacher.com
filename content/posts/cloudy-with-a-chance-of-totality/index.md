After watching [the first lightning talk at DjangoCon US last year](https://youtu.be/M3-WlpJFcKM?si=pI_PoiISA6j4Xpnz&t=22), I was inspired to see and photograph the next eclipse[^1], and wouldn't you know it, my house was just outside the path of totality, so I had to see it. Plus I was recently gifted some hand-me-down camera lenses and one of them happened to be 250mm. Just enough to get some good pictures!

Fast forward to the day of the eclipse. I had all my gear ready and when I checked the weather for the day...cloudy with a chance of ~~totality~~ rain. I didn't let that stop me, however, and I was hopeful that the clouds would part. So I drove to my viewing spot in the path of totality and set up shop.

As predicted, it was very cloudy, and I struggled to find the right settings for the camera, but was able to dial it in just enough when the sun poked through the clouds. As the time drew near...and then past...I was worried I wasn't going to see anything, but a few minutes later the clouds parted just enough for me to get some, I think, amazing amateur shots! It was really fun watching the moon make its way across the sun.

My dreams were short-lived however as, right before totality, the clouds returned, blocking out the money shot! I was incredibly disappointed, but at least I was able to enjoy the eerie feeling of day turning to night.

Ah well, I guess I will just have to try again in 2045!
