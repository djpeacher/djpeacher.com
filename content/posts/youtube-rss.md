About [6 month ago](https://fosstodon.org/@djpeacher/110471585752450798) I discovered that every channel and playlist on YouTube has an RSS feed, and since then I've been slowly "re-subscribing" to all my favorite channels. It really has been an amazing way to experience YouTube without all the algorithmic noise.

Just add the following feeds with your desired channel or playlist to your favorite RSS reader!
You should be able to find channel IDs in its about section.

```
www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<ID>
www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=<ID>
```
