> Turns out subtracting is hard [when tracking monster damage]...so instead of subtracting damage from its monsters hit points, I would just track the damage up...when the damage it took crosses over its hit points, then it's time to die...so what I started doing was just using X's and slashes.

This is a great suggestion! I've just been using standard tally marks, but I could definitely see how this streamlines things. Going to have to try it out at my next game. 

TLDR: Use `/` for 5 damage and `X` for 10 damage. Cross a `/` with `\` to make an `X`. Use standard tallies for remainders. When you cross out 5 tallies, create a new `/` and disregard those tallies.
