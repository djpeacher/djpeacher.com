Well that was probably the most interesting WWDC in a while. Not saying it was great or perfect, but definitely a turning point. That intro was amazing though! Here's what caught my eye along with my gut reaction:

## iOS

- Custom home screen icon placement - **_Wow, finally._**
- Custom home screen icon tints - **_Hmm, not quite right._**
- Ability to lock apps - **_Nice, but also sherlocks this as a paid app feature._**
- Ability to hide apps - **_Sus stuff aside, hiding utility apps is a win._**
- iMessage RCS support - **_Finally._**
- iMessage rich text - **_Oh cool._**
- iMessage emoji tapbacks - **_Finally. Yes. Perfect._**
- iMessage scheduled texts - **_Finally. Yes. Perfect._**
- iMessage over satelite - **_Oh cool._**
- Airpods shake/nod for accept/decline - **_Oh cool. That won't misfire at all..._**

## watchOS

- Live activities - **_Oh cool. Also cool that it reuses dynamic island activities._**
- Vitals app - **_Oh cool, hopefully useful._**

## iPadOS

- SharePlay drawing - **_Oh cool. I need this on iOS!_**
- SharePlay control - **_Oh cool. I need this on iOS!_**
- Calculator app - **_Wow, finally._**
- Math notes with calculations, variables, and graphs - **_Oh wow, yes! Amazing! Wish I had this in college._**
- Smart script for cleaning hand writing, pasting, and spell checking - **_Oh wow, yes! My hand writing is miserable._**

## macOS

- iPhone Mirroring - **_Oh wow, love it, now add this to SharePlay!_**
- iPhone Notifications - **_Oh wow, yes! I've wanted this before!_**
- Tile snapping - **_Wow, finally._**
- Passwords App - **_Wow, finally._**
  - _I don't think this sherlocks existing password managers. I think the main win here is that this is going to get more people to actually use a password manger who would never before. I‚Äôm not switching anytime soon, but this is still a big win and step forward for online security generally._

## visionOS

- Widescreen mac mirroring - **_Nice, I'm sure others will love this._**
