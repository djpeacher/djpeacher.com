Decluttering at the Speed of Life by Dana K. White

> Store food storage containers with their lids on...I put lids on containers as I take them out of the dish-washer (or off the dish drainer when I hand wash) and stick them in the cabinet. They donâ€™t nest, so no finagling is required. When I need a container, I grab it. All of it. No searching for a matching lid.

Finally got around to listening to this book that was recommended by [Jeff Triplett on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@webology/110437362488781280). This tupperware quote is my favorite, and most impactful! My wife and I have only been doing this for about a week and it's already paying dividends.

This is the way.
