Being the Apple nerd that I am, when I found out there was going to be demos of the Vision Pro, I had to sign up! It‚Äôs not everyday you get to try out a new Apple product.

Here are some of my first impressions:

_Display_. I was a little disappointed with the display. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a really good display, but I was really hoping Apple would have come out swinging with something orders of magnitude better than the competition. I found the display too dim and pixelated, slow at times, and contained too much [vignetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignetting) around the edges. I think the only thing that saved the display for me were the prescription eye inserts.

_Controls_. The eye-hand controls are by far the defining feature of the Vision Pro. It was incredibly intuitive and eerily accurate. It honestly felt like it was reading my mind, and I quickly started zooming around the UI. I did get a few false positives here and there, but I think I‚Äôll blame my fidgety hands for that. One thing I didn‚Äôt like too much however, was that it really made me think about what my eyes were doing, and I could already feel the strain in the short time that I used it. Only thing I forgot to try was the virtual keyboard...eh, it was probably bad anyway.

_3D Content_. I was shown some of the 3D photos and videos you can create, and too be honest they just felt like blurry [lenticular cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing) and were not all that interesting. 3D movies were fun to see again, and the 3D environments you can place yourself in were a bit more intriguing, but it was Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúImmersive Videos‚Äù where things really started to shine. They were absolutely amazing, and it nearly brought a tear to my eye because I really felt like I was there...I left wanting more.

_Comfort_. Generally speaking, it was comfortable, but wow was it heavy. I felt the pressure mostly along my nose and cheek bones, and I could feel it well after the session had ended, not to mention the prominent red mark around my face. I know Apple really wants everyone to use that "solo knit band", but I would probably never use it in favor of the "dual loop band".

So, am I going to buy the Vision Pro? No! It is way too expensive, not to mention the accessories, but if I had a few thousand dollars lying around, sure I'd buy one. I do think it's an amazing product, and the start of an exciting journey, but I could never justify it in its current state. Besides, we all know what the end game is here ü§ì
