title: What Am I?
description: With so many different job titles and specializations in the tech industry, it's hard to know what to call yourself. These are the conclusions I've come to...

I am someone who generally writes code using web-based technologies. What am I? This question has bugged me for years and I think I've finally come to a conclusion.

If you like spoilers, look at my [home page](/) or the [TLDR](#tldr) below. If not, here is my breakdown. Keep in mind that there exists many more titles than I mention below, but I am just trying to focus on my field. This is also just based on what I've been exposed to and I am happy to be proven wrong.

So what am I? Let's start at the beginning...

## Programmer/Coder

I am 100% a programmer and a coder. Those two words essentially mean the same thing. I write programs with code.

While I think all other titles fall under this category, I do not consider it a job title. It's just too generic to represent an occupation.

## Software Engineer vs. Software Developer

Going a level deeper, we find Software Engineers and Software Developers. As far as I can tell, both of these mean the same thing, and the word "Software" is optional. These titles represent anyone who designs and creates systems to solve problems.

So I am a [Software] Engineer/Developer?

## Web vs. Mobile vs. Desktop

Well, we can go another layer deeper and specialize in web, mobile, or desktop applications which produces these lovely titles:

- Web [Software] Engineer/Developer
- Mobile [Software] Engineer/Developer
- Desktop [Software] Engineer/Developer

They all do the same thing, just in their respective specialization.

So am I any of these? Well yes, I primarily specialize in the web, but with tools like React Native, Expo, and Electron, those lines are beginning to blur.

## Full-Stack vs. Backend vs. Frontend

Unfortunately, we can go yet another layer deeper and specialize in the frontend, backend, or even both layers of an application, thus producing even more titles:

- Full-Stack [Web/Software] Engineer/Developer
- Backend [Web/Software] Engineer/Developer
- Frontend/UI [Web/Software] Engineer/Developer

These terms primarily get used in web environments (which is why I wrote "Web/Software"), but they could also apply to mobile and desktop.

This one is easy for me. I work across the entire stack, so I must be a Full-Stack [Web/Software] Engineer/Developer?

## Seniority Epithets

Okay great, so we are done, right? Well, we could add seniority epithets like "Senior," "Staff," or "Principle," if applicable, but as far as I can tell, their usefulness depends on context.

If you are trying to describe what you do at your current position, identifying yourself as senior or not doesn't make a difference since both senior and non-senior developers do the same thing. Being "senior", however, usually means you have significant enough ownership and trust that you are the go-to person in a particular area. Of course, this varies from employer to employer, and a senior title could include additional responsibilities.

If you are looking for a new job, applying to a senior role could have a special meaning to employers. Every project is different and usually requires you to learn new technologies. From a prospective employer's point of view, if they are looking for a senior developer, it could mean they don't have the bandwidth or capacity to train someone up into a senior position. So noting seniority on your resume is good, but that doesn't necessarily mean you qualify for another senior position.

## Okay, so what am I?

I am someone who designs and creates systems to solve problems on the web across both the frontend and backend. And thanks to cross-platform technologies, it has never been easier for me to take my web development skills and port them over to mobile and desktop environments. Based on this description, the best titles for me are:

- Engineer
- Developer
- Software Engineer
- Software Developer

All of these titles mean essentially the same thing, but I could see some ambiguity if I just used Engineer or Developer. So we are down to two:

- Software Engineer
- Software Developer

At this point, it just comes down to personal preference. Also, there is no point in including any seniority epithets since it doesn't change what I do day-to-day. Besides at the end of the day...

I am a **Software Engineer**!
